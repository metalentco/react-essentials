This thing ain't ready yet. But when it is, oh boy:

- Authentication UI flows already built out for email, Facebook and Google
- Toast popup system already set up for user feedback
- Push API for extra important user alerts
- VERY few dependencies
- Basic security rules written for Firestore
- A pinch of mother's love
