## Skeleton for your app. Just add guts!

**Live demo at: (https://react-firebase-essentials.com)**

This is a full stack application, indended to provide the basic features that any online product or service may need, so that you can get straight to building out the important parts of your MVP without getting bogged down with the boring tasks that you've already done for a million apps before.

Modern and professional authentication UI flows have already been built out, it's as simple as plugging in your Firebase API keys. Basic security rules have already been written for the database. It's built entirely with React Hooks and the new Context API, utilizing Styled-Components, and requires very few dependencies. Built on top of Create-React-App.

To get started, make sure you have both Create-React-App and the Firebase CLI installed. Copy the contents in .env and create an `.env.production.local` and put your Firebase credentials there, and be sure to create an `.env.development.local` for working locally as well. Make sure you `npm run build` before deploying to Firebase.

Also includes Push Notifications and Dark Mode out of the box! Styled using global variables, allowing you to quickly and easily adjust to your tastes.
